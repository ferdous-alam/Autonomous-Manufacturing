# Brain for AMSPnC: Offline policy
This is the policy learned from the source task; 48 FEM simulations. During this implementation the policy is not updated with real data obtained from AMSPnC. 

## Details:
    - Run policy for 24 timesteps --> 24 3D printed artifacts 
    - Dump files are created with all the decision making details

## Notes: 
    - Please delete the any pre-existing files on the dump folder
    - Make sure **sample_count = 0** in the LABVIEW file.
